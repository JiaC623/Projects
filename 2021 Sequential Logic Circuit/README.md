# Sequential Logic Circuit with Blinking LEDs
2021.11 - 2021.12
From course ENGPHYS 2E04. The objective was to create a sequential logic circuit to blink the LEDs in the order of our student number.<br>
<br>

_Since 2^3 = 8 < 9 < 2^4, we would need 4 bit binary to represent number. If some numbers repeated, then we would like to add counter number to distinguish._ 
<br> 

> _For instance, <strong>two</strong> 2s would need 1 bit counter numbers: [0],[1];_ <br>

> _<strong>three</strong> 0s would need 2 bit counter numbers [00], [01], [10]._ <br>

<br>
In total, 4+2=6 bits were required.<br>
Each bit would need both J and !K to determine.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>

## :sparkles: Process
The key point was to find out the logic of this sequence of numbers. <br>
<br>

### JK Flip-flop

The second thing was to understand the use of JK flip-flop. <br>
| J_n | K_n | Q_(n+1) |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 0 | 0 | Q_n(hold) |
| 1 | 1 | 0(reset) |
| 1 | 1 | 1(set) |
| 1 | 1 | !Q_n(toggle) |
<br>
Now we can generate a table (yes it is long) for J and !K values corresponding to each bit in each individual student number. <br>
Take student number 2012300 for example. Each of the bits, from Q4 to C1, would have its own J and !K values. 

<br>
<br>

| student number | Q4 | Q3 | Q2 | Q1 | C2 | C1 |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | X | X |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | X | X |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

<br>

Notice the rows of different 0 and 2. And the single 1 and 3 would be X because it did not matter. <br>
For this reason, the combination of counter bits can also differ, making it maybe easier or harder for circuit. And it would need to find the optimum case. <br>
<br>
<br>

### SOP/POS

They stand for **sum of products** and **product of sums**.

After we had done **K-mapping** (Karnaugh map, a method to simplify Boolean algebra expressions), usually the same number (1/0) grouped together would be ideal, we could find the expressions.

<br>
<br>

They would be further expanded and provide some relationships that are applicable for connecting in circuit with flip-flops and gates. And based on how many kinds and numbers were used, the simplest one was then chosen to connect. 

<br>

In application, keep in mind that gates are interconvertible.
